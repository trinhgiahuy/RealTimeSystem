# Yocto SDK

The full documentation for the Yocto SDK can be found at this [link][yocto-sdk-manual].

Yocto SDK for a given target can either be downloaded from the official Yocto Project website (if the combination of host and target machine is officially supported) or generated for a given image (e.g., `core-image-minimal`) from your personal Yocto project.

In our case, given that we are using a custom target, we need to generate it.

For this exercise we will be using the Standard SDK.

# Generating SDK from Yocto

```bash
source poky/oe-init-build-env build
bitbake core-image-minimal -c populate_sdk
```

The generation process will take a very long time (more than 85 minutes running on the VM in the lab) and also considerable disk space and bandwidth.
Instead you can directly use the artifact generated by this process from [build/tmp/deploy/sdk/poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-cortexa9hf-neon-toolchain-2.4.3.sh][sdk-archive].

# Installing the Yocto SDK

Full details are available in the [official manual][yocto-sdk-manual] (read it!).

In short, assuming you downloaded the autoextracting script in `/tmp`:

```bash
bash /tmp/poky-glibc-x86_64-core-image-minimal-cortexa9hf-neon-toolchain-2.4.3.sh -d ~/opt/poky-sdk/2.4.3
```

# Using the Yocto SDK

In the terminal session where you want to cross-compile for your yocto target machine:

```bash
cd <folder_of_your_standalone_application_project>
source ~/opt/poky-sdk/2.4.3/environment-setup-cortexa9hf-neon-poky-linux-gnueabi
make <executable_name>
```
